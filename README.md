# Factor_Analysis_USL
This project applies exploratory factor analysis to uncover latent factors driving correlations among multiple variables. Using KMO, Bartlett’s test, eigenvalues, and varimax rotation, the analysis reduces dimensionality and improves interpretability by identifying key underlying constructs influencing observed data patterns.
